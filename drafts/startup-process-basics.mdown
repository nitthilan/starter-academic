- Create small bots and let them live in the world
- Can have different world based on the characteristics of each bot i.e. options you give the bot
- Basic primary charateristics are programmed by the engine while the user uses the primary characteristics to code the complex characteristics of the object
- Allow the ability to code as many as possible
- Ability to monitor your bots and how they move around the world
- Each bot has a identity - A heirarchical identity like nitthilan-Child of Kannappan-Male-Animal-Bangalorean etc. This helps in programming i.e. if(Bangalorean) do this i.e. identities are used to identify for what all objects the condition has to be executed
- Programming could be as simple as 
- Series of if else conditions (switch statements) and a collection of while loops (For and while)
- Each code could be made as module and you could learn or copy module from one to the other and use it in your code
- Ideally you create one or more loop for every bot. This loop gets executed as a day to day activity. based on who or what they interact with the if else conditions get triggered and execute their own loop
- Each bot has a high level goal which guides their life time and is described by the loop
