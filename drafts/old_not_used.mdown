Posterior Regularisation:
parametric
regularization in a Bayesian framework, our approach incorporates data-dependent constraints that
are easy to encode as information about model posteriors on the observed data, but may be difficult
to encode as information about model parameters through Bayesian priors.

Generative models  are usually estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data
by marginalizing over the hidden variables, typically via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm

Staying at Spokane: http://www.sleepinginairports.net/usa/spokaneWash.htm

Amtrak at morning 6:15am: https://www.wanderu.com/en/depart/Spokane%2C%20WA%2C%20USA/Pullman%2C%20WA%2099163%2C%20USA/2017-08-16
Amtrak has bus service from International airport to pullman directly. Starts at 5:15pm. If not train from station starts at 5:45pm. Else 

Wheatland Express at 2:00pm


Get enough food and sleep for some 4-5 hours. Then board a amtrak at 6:15am
According to their web site, the airport is open 24 hours but all the car rental outfits at the airport close down at 00:30am or earlier and reopen at 06:00am or later.
