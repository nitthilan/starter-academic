##### Stories
[My brother](#my-brother)

###### My brother

As I stood there waiting for the bus/plane to arrive, my thouhgts dragged me to the past. Its been a while. It was one of those days. You have been thinking of saying something to your parents but did not have the confidence to talk about it. It was not different for a girl in here ninth grade.

My artificial deadline was before the van arrives for the school that day. I want to vent it all out on my parents. 

"Kanna, are you out of your bed. Its getting late for school." Amma/Mom gave morning alert. Mickey was licking my feet. She curled down at my feet after her morning ritual of dropping the newspaper at my fathers bedside. "Han, Ma. I am up."  If not next she would be up in my room banging the door. This is her alarm. She is the final failsafe alarm when all alarms fail. Probably thats true about life too. Not sure. Parents. 

It all started few months back as a joke. As usual, I did not finish my lunch. "Yaen di. Innaikuma. Everyday this has becoma habit. If this carries on, I will sell you and get a new kid" "Try it. You never know. I may get better parents. or worse you may get even fussy brother" "Why brother? You do not like a sister." "There could never be a better girl than me" "Fine. Atleast have dinner now. We will decide your auction date after a while"

I slowly walked to the bathroom, reluctantly. One, I hate my science teacher and her so called surprise tests scheduled today. Two, I was not sure how I am going to share my thoughts with my parents. My brush poking its way around my mouth as I ruminate on these thoughts. Standing under the shower, I felt the water was cold today. Probably it would rain and the school would get cancelled. "Anju, Can you hurry up a little? Its getting late for my office" Appa knocked on my door. I can hear Mickey too scratching the door. Stepping out I thought I should go through all I wanted to talk once again as I dressed up. Today it PT class. I have to wear white today. As I stepped out of my room, amma had already prepared the lunch. Appa was also ready to leave for office. I sat on the couch, my throne. Appa was at my feet dusting my socks and cleaning my shoes. Amma came with dosa on the plate ready to stuff it in my mouth before I run away to catch the van. there was a 5 minute gap. The right time. "Appa, is it necessary to bring in a yonger brother" Appa paused a little "Yaen ma, why this question suddenly?" Amma, dipped a piece of dosa in sambar and as it dripped on the plate "Solluma. What are your thoughts?" "Illa ma. I am not feeling comfortable." Appa dropped the shoes and took me on his lap and with a concerned face "Solluda. Why do you feel uncomfortable" "You said, two days back during dinner that you are planning to have sibling." "Hmmm" Amma fed a socked dosa in my mounth. "Are you worried that you will have a competition." "Do not worry da. I will clean both your shoes." With a muffled voice of dosa in mouth "Unhun. Thats not a issue. Is it necesary to bring a new sibling?" "Ennada sollura. I am not able to understand what you are saying?" "Illa pa. Last year. On the way to Raju Sithappa place, it was raining heavily and we hit a dog by accident." "Sari. Amma, Thats were we found mickey. She came limping towards us." "Athan pa solluren. Last Sunday when we were sitting on the beach, there was a small kid selling Sundal. Why cannot he be my sibling?" Appa smiled. Amma fed the last piece of dosa and I rushed for the van. 
My phone vibrated, breaking my thought process. "Hey Anju, where are you?" "Vaada. Just walk outside and walk towards the taxi stand." If not for that day, I would not have met Koushik, my brother.
