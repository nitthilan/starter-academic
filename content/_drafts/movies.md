- Always be like someone who is learning something new...keeping a innocent face...do not be theall knowing guy
- quote the observations and not with authority
- once upon a time
- Start multiple stories..keep meandering and then come back to first and say that you forgot about it and 
- Probably start it as a cooking tutorial, keep adding a little move to other talks, add a little more to the dish, move away....and end punch line...I think I had my dinner in MacD

Story ideas:
- In house there are two people - one is a ghost but the ghost assume that he is not dead and does not believe in ghost while the other person is a normal person and he comes up with ideas about ghost. Two thoughts
	- The ghost keeps saying that the weird things happening in the house is not due to ghost and is some natural occurance. While the guys keeps saying that no it is due to the ghost. The house is probably a booby trap for some treasure and so has lot of gimmicks and jumpscares. The final twist is the guys atlast comes to know he has been talking to the ghost all along and the ghost gives the final jump scare while the whole stuff before it is not
	- the ghost all through goes through the jump scares all the while dismissing each and every aspect of it as a booby trap and slowy starts belienving that ghosts are possible until in the end he gets reminded that he was killed in one such booby trap and finds his deadbody...probably that is the highest form of jumpscare the point where he feels that he is going to meet the ghost he finds himself dead
	- Make the house a booby trap for a treasure or let the house be halloween house
- Can a ghost movie be made with first person immersive where the audience is a character

High level themes to be touched:
- Black lives matter - Talk about caste system
- Color discrimination - Losing self confidence because of being man of color
- Body shaming - Being Fat
- 

Story ideas:
===========
- A person wrties a story adn each chapter ends 
	- With him narating one episode and the next chapter is about the response for that story from people and how the book progress based on the feed back
- Two people meet each day on a bus
	- They keep sharing their life experiences to each other
	- How each form a opinion about each other based on these stories
	- How relationships ensue like talking about his girlfriend the girl assumes he may not like her etc

	- There is a driver who manages the car
	- The people getting in the car get in to kill the driver
	- The driver is assuming they are planning a heist but they heist is staged to kill the driver
	- The driver goes about the heist as a normal dad. Like taking about his family, to friends, like a matter of fact

- peter sellers pink panther style detective story
- student trying to solve complete a project
	- simple
- decide on how you respond to each person

--------------------------
As I stood there waiting for the bus/plane to arrive, my thouhgts dragged me to the past. Its been a while. It was one of those days. You have been thinking of saying something to your parents but did not have the confidence to talk about it. It was not different for a girl in here ninth grade. I have been contemplating whether to say this or not. Days have passed. Sometimes you feel that elders are dumber than kids. Its weird that with more and more knowledge we become dumb and dumber. Probably its the way the wolrd says to you "Hey bud. You thought you were big. Let me show you how small you are." The more we know abut the world the more we get to know we do not know a lot. Making you more and more insecure. Anyway, on that day I decided that I should say it. Sometimes you just put a artificial deadline to your decision. Its been the way how a introvert tries to be an extrovenrt.
Introverts have this never ending discussion in their mind. The things which the extroverts say ourt loud the introvert has it in their mind. They continousuly talking to themselves. "Is it right to do it. Know it is not. But why are they still doing it. Do they not see what I see. "

My artificial deadline was before the bus arrives for the school that day. I want to vent it all out on my parents. I should have done it over the weekend. When usually you have the time with your parents. But thats not the case. Thats when you have the relatives visit. Or that old neighbor who stayed next to your haouse some 10 years ago. Its not them visiting which is frustrating. Its when they say "Hey kanna, you look the same like when you were a kid. You have not changed at all." Its 10 years and I still look like the same old punny girl. No. Never.

"Kanna, are you out of your bed. Its getting late for school." Amma/Mom gave morning alert. "Han, Ma. I am up." If not next she would be up in my room banging the door. This is her alarm. She is the final failsafe alarm when all alarms fail. Probably thats true about life too. Not sure. Parents. 

It all started few months back as a joke. As usual, I did not finish my lunch. "Yaen di. Innaikuma. Everyday this has becoma habit. If this carries on, I will sell you and get a new kid" "Try it. You never know. I may get better parents. or worse you may get even fussy brother" "Why brother? You do not like a sister." "There could never be a better girl than me" "Fine. Atleast have dinner now. We will decide your auction date after a while"

Then after few days later, during our dinner, father 

I got up slowly

I slowly walked to the bathroom, reluctantly. One, I hate my science teacher and her so called surprise tests scheduled today. Two, I was not sure how I am going to share my thoughts with my parents. My brush poking its way around my mouth as I ruminate on these thoughts. Standing under the shower, I felt the water was cold today. Probably it would rain and the school would get cancelled. "Anju, Can you hurry up a little? Its getting late for my office" Appa knocked on my door. Stepping out I thought I should go through all I wanted to talk once again as I dressed up. Today it PT class. I have to wear white today. As I stepped out of my room, amma had already prepared the lunch. Appa was also ready to leave for office. I sat on the couch, my throne. Appa was at my feet dusting my socks and cleaning my shoes. Amma came with dosa on the plate ready to stuff it in my mouth before I run away to catch the van. there was a 5 minute gap. The right time. "Appa, is it necessary to bring in a yonger brother" Appa paused a little "Yaen ma, why this question suddenly?" Amma, dipped a piece of dosa in sambar and as it dripped on the plate "Solluma. What are your thoughts?" "Illa ma. I am not feeling comfortable." Appa dropped the shoes and took me on his lap and with a concerned face "Solluda. Why do you feel uncomfortable" "You said, two days back during dinner that you are planning to have sibling." "Hmmm" Amma fed a socked dosa in my mounth. "Are you worried that you will have a competition." "Do not worry da. I will clean both your shoes." With a muffled voice of dosa in mouth "Unhun. Thats not a issue. Is it necesary to bring a new sibling?" "Ennada sollura. I am not able to understand what you are saying?" "Illa pa. Last year. On the way to Raju Sithappa place, we hit a dog by accident." "Sari. Amma, namba Mickey anga thanae kedachan. " "Athan pa solluren. Last Sunday when we were sitting on the beach, there was a small kid selling Sundal. Why cannot he be my sibling?" Appa smiled. Amma fed the last piece of dosa and I rushed for the van. 
My phone vibrated, breaking my thought process. "Hey Anju, where are you?" "Vaada. Just walk outside and walk towards the taxi stand." If not for that day, I would not have met Koushik, my brother.

"Kanna, are you out of your bed. Its getting late for school." Amma/Mom gave morning alert. Mickey was licking my feet.

title: Ideal proposal
- Make the talk casual. Do not over empahsize the thought
- Check whether she is single and is not in a relationship
- Mention recently you have been hearing to her songs repeatedly and liked it very much.
- Further, she is your sister and so she would have similar characteristics. So thouhgt should check if at all she would be interested
- It is not love or anything. I liked her and I am in a phase where I am seriously thinking about settling. So thought to check if she would be interested. 
- Is there a possibility to consider?
- Would you check with her and let me know?
- It makes sense to talk to you rather than pinging her directly
- I am pretty open and willing to ahre as much details as possible
- I am pretty open to share any details if required.
- Financially, I think I am well settled but not so great. But have plans for making it big in the future. I have to some extent have come down a little assuming I can go much beyond. Just a thought
- My father is a doctor and mother is a house wife. 

- Talk to her sister and check if it fine to talk to her
- Talk to her and see how eager she is
- Make sure this does not spoil the friendship
- Make sure even if she says know you would still be interested and if there is any change of heart I will still be open.
- 

- Apologise for being so blunt but is your sister in a relationship.
- Your sister has a beutiful voice and I love her songs. 

- Did you know what I was going to talk about? The way you said yes it was like you were expecting something like this
- Love is a strong word. I do not know her that much. I like her and feel it would be good to know her better.
- I love her songs. She is a doctor and most importantly she is your sister so she should be good.
- I wanted to check with you whether she would be interested. Our friendship is more important what ever may be the final result. Further, I know you more that your sister.
- I want the journey to be that of peers. She would have herr own dreams and me mine. I prefer we travel together as friends relishing on each others achiement. I felt she would be someone like that. 
- Financially, I have a decent background. I have earned and saved sufficiently for myself (like have some prperties on my name). Worst case I can always dip into my fathers though I would not prefer it.
- I am very flexible and very approchable. She can talk about anything and everything and I do not mind sharing it. So if possible ask her whether she would be interested to talk and discuss about this.
- Would she be willing to discuss this possibility. Worst case I would get a good friend. Somehow it is currently weird the way she responds. Its very restricted


Hi, in the iissue of being so long I will go ahead and still put all my thoughts into a letter. 

Hi Dr., 

This message is going to be, long. So grab something to eat or get a cup of coffee. Its easier to put my thoughts into a letter. I assume Swarnita had already talked to you and so will jump into my thoughts directly. 

A little background about myself. I have a very supportive and kind family who is very open and encouraging. My father is a doctor too. Like Swarnita, I too have a little sister and as you grew up in a Joint family (which I could not guess until Swarnita told explicitly, kudos to you twins), my family too is a close-knit family of cousins but probably slightly bigger. Grandfathers you know. 

Life has its own course and there are periods of ups and periods of down. Like a roller coaster. But in the end its the journey. So I see a relationship as more of a good friend who you can share this journey with. Talk about how thrilling and exciting the ride is. It has been one thrilling ride till now and am hoping to share more exciting things in the future.

I am a dreamer too and have an interest in varied fields. I like to draw or paint but unfortunately like any Indian family tradition was given the option of only Engineering and Medicine. I chose the former. However, am trying to go back to my interests like trying to explore AI/ML for animation, music, art, etc. Trying to make my passion as my work. Took a while but should reach there soon. 

I believe everyone has their own dreams would love to share that journey and if possible, support each other or at least be a shoulder to rest [on when you are tired] or lend an ear [when you want to bounce ideas on].

There may be a lot of difference between us be it in culture, state, language, profession, probably even in direction (we consider anyone from above TN us North and You would probably see us as South :P). One could see these as incompatibilities (aspects we differ on). But these differences make it interesting to explore each other's culture. Experience and enjoy new experiences.

I may have been pretty forward when I directly pinged you but that's more of a fanboy effect :P. Yeh Dil Bechara. Have been binging (not sure whether that's the right word) your songs in a loop. Have created a playlist of all your songs. Will continue disturbing you in that regard, regardless of how you feel about me. Anyway, that's for another time.

Based on what Swarnita told me, you have been through a difficult time and things may be little dark at present. I cannot say I could be a light at this time. It's was your personal journey and I would be dumb to assume I too can feel it. However, I can assure you I would be able to wait and be supportive as a friend would be, as you find your way around. Sounds too filmy :P but in effect, that's what I mean to say. The only way to prove is to show it and words would not hold water.

I am pretty open and willing to share anything about me. It could either be about me, about my financials, my habits, anything where you have doubts/clarifications/questions. I can discuss anything. Nothing to hide. If you are willing to have a discussion we can always talk anytime. 

In short, I like you. If you too are interested, we can talk with an open mind and see where this goes? What say?


Well this is off the chest, I assume we can talk normally for the love of songs. Hope I would get replies other than "Thank U".

The last two songs are yet to come on youtube and I do not have a copy lost in 

Well 
If you have an open mind  Its hard to convince someone who has already taken a decision. Would you be interested in giving me a try and see how this goes.

The hitting part is how it is ingrained into kids that too at this very young age.
4:21
Even worse is the difference between boys and girls. While girls are asked to make tea boys are not
4:24
Look at the high standard he maintains. A boy does not go for lunch because, the other people would get up and go if he sits with them. Though he feels ashamed, he is sacrificing his hunger for the hunger of others.
4:26
"The teacher is lying" Epic reply.

JayKay  5:35 PM
They have put so much innovation in practicing untouchability making people remove slippers, not using the milk and sending it to Amul dairy, pouring water from a distance, arranging kids in order of their caste.
5:37
Looks like the only thing which unites us all North, South, East or West is practicing untouchability

JayKay  5:44 PM
Most believe that it's a rule or a world order and do not realise their legal rights has been violated. The ignorance still stumps me. Feeling little ashamed to have been part which believes that caste based discrimination in education is wrong. Looks like we still need more awareness.
5:47
Looks like one Periyar is not enough.

Ravi  5:51 PM
I too was against reservation when this issue cane up during UPA. But that is when I was ignorant of these issues.

JayKay  5:53 PM
The school and probably the uniform system is a very great levelling field. Kids say they talk to others at school but not at their homes.
5:55
A manger sits on the ground, elders address children with respect.
5:58
Every region in India has a part to play in this.
6:01
I do knot know whether to laugh or cry. Even within themselves, there is differences. People from one do not drink or eat at the other's place
6:03
Just half way through. It's so compelling like a thriller. Do watch it makkale

Ravi  6:04 PM
It is also interspersed with manusmrithi

JayKay  6:06 PM
Actually, I had a high thought or had a high esteem about manu shasthra. But looks like it it not so. Probably there are parts like how warfare has to happen etc which makes sense but this side of it is pathetic

Ravi  6:07 PM
The problem is people who deny them as isolated incident. They are the one that needs to be educated
:raised_hands:

:+1:

JayKay  6:07 PM
I detest the analogy of depicting the caste system with a human form. Saying head is this and hand is that...
6:10
Especially the fact that the head and hands act as saviours when the foot is hurt. BS.

They claim that this is what Shankarachrya claims as right.

I like his quote of "How privilege has become merit"

They take money from them, extracts work from them but would not use or touch things they have touched
1:49
Only animals use intelligence, humans just follow what their ancestors have said - LOL

JayKay  1:55 PM
Weird how just 10% of a group can control a group of 70%...this has been a pattern in different parts of the world in different forms

JayKay  2:10 PM
"Avangaluku vanthu bloodu vanthu blue colorla irruku, engalluku red colorla irruku" - Lol

JayKay  2:15 PM
Dalit Christians are the worst discriminated. I too have thought ill about them at some point. Looks like they are discriminated both from Christianity and from the others too
2:18
All religion in their scriptures have said discrimination is a sin and have tried to abolish them (this is seen in Christianity and in Sikhs, probably even in Islam but not sure about Hinduism since we have so many gods some based on caste itself) but while following them people have trodden into different directions
2:19
or have probably taken advantage of the situation and created a myth of hierarchy to enslave people

JayKay  2:26 PM
They are born separately, they live separately it make sense to separate them at death too. So we have separate cemeteries.  - :disappointed:

JayKay  2:44 PM
My eyes became foggy. The happiness in the eyes, when she could draw water from a well. When the kid drank water offered by his friend. Yet a grown man did not accept the offered tea. One is innocent the other is bitter by experience. Both cannot be blamed.
2:45
A must watch. I cannot stress its importance more.
