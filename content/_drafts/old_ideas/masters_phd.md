Hi Jana,
	After the discussions we had regarding PhD I still not convinced on two points:
	(1) The confidence of completing it in 3.5 years
    (2) Since I may not be interested in EDA, I may not be able to hit the ground running. Identifying an new area of interest and would this delay the PhD degree? 

I feel I would be able to get a opinion on these only after working for sometime. So at this point, if you feel I would be able to achieve this in the given time frame, I am willing to pursue my PhD based on the faith of your judegement. 

Since I do not have previous experience in Academic Research I am not I feel I would not be able to judge these points until I start working on my research for some time. Since I am at this point not able to judge this, I am willing to take the decision of doing PhD, based on the faith of your judgement. So if you feel I would be able to acieve this in the given time frame I am willing to pursue my PhD.

Regarding the area of research, certain feedback I observed from your responses are:
- AGI is something which is pursued by big companies like google who have more people, compute and resources and we getting gobbled up in the process. 
- Second, identifying a specific area of application. Image based is too crowded but research related to video would be fine.

Regarding the AGI, as you suggested we can try carving out a sub-problem and try working on a smaller problem which is more tractable.

Regarding the area of application, off late I have been thinking of application of Artificial Intelligence to the area of Animation. What is your opinion on this area? 

The general principles which I base this is I see a potential for lot of content being produced in the near future and find animation/graphics/vfx seem to have a huge part in the future. Further, currently the time taken to produce a 3d animation movie is a pretty long. I was trying to learn some graphics/animation. In that I found that the time it takes to animate an object invovles managing a lot of curves and manipulations. I was thinking whether machine learning could be a good solution to many of such problems. 

Further, when I tried googling about animation and Machine learning, I did not find a lot a research material. I am not sure what are the current trends and practices in this area. How should I approach this area and try to find out whether this is a worthwhile problem to pursue? Your thoughts and ideas please.

Unfortunately, I did not get much time to read on the material you have been sharing. I would start it again so that we could continue our discussion to reach a problem soon.


Hi Jana,
     I read through all the previous mails. Based on all the discussion we had now, I still have two points
Hi Jana,
	After the discussions we had, the points which I am still not confidant are 
    (1) The confidence of completing it in 3.5 years
    (2) Working long-term in the area of EDA

Both the above points require me to work in the area for sometime before I can get a confidence.
Since I am not capable of visualising these, if you can give me the confidence that the above two should not be problem, I am willing to take up PhD based on faith of your judgement.

Regarding the area of research, 

The general feel about choosing AGI seems to be little tough. One area I wanted to work was in the area Computer graphics in creating animation movies. This may look weird but in general an animation movie seems to take a long time to produce and I see a huge potential for automation in the areas of deciding on the various mechanics for graphics animations. I have not worked on earlier projects in this domain but looks like a prospective area

So at the current state I am not able to visualise how I would be able to meet those two constraints. However, baring this I would love to take up this opportunity. If I can get a confirmation from your side that these two should not be a issue and I would be definitely able to achive my target, then based on your faith I would like to take the plunge into doing a PhD. 

Other minor concerns of working with freshers
Also, I enjoy working with you but when it comes to collaboration, I may have to work along with people fresh out of college which though I love to do may be little difficult


The cycle for EDA research paper is shorter when compared to a ML research paper. We can hit a good balance between both areas to meet the goals. I will also create opportunities for other projects as needed so that you get exposed to wide variety of problems and algorithms, and to be able to build a good CV by the time of your graduation.

university level fellowship (~5K) for you
apply for external fellowships like Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook.
you can secure internal (WSU) and external (Google, Microsoft, IBM etc.) fwllowships -- 20K$ per year.
In 2014, I had an offer from Google Research for $160K per year and it may have gone up significantly due to the boom of machine learning and data science


Applications evolve over time as I develop projects and find good application domain people. Some current applications are cyber-physical systems (e.g., smart homes), mobile health, and personalized behavioral coaching; learning over networks (can dream up a lot of applications from social to biology) -- will start soon; had worked on natural language processing and computer vision in the past, but there is too much competition in this space from both industry and academia, but I could be interested in video analysis.

A research project should get funding???
- The other researcher on robots ???

I usually pick novel research problems motivated by real-world applications so that competition is low; or pursue important existing problems when I have a good inisight; or pursue an important application of high impact that requires careful formulation and adaptation of existing algorithmic frameworks. 

It is important to pick problems so that you won't get scooped out easily and when you know that there are people who have better skills and/or resources to solve those problems. - ???
- Is graphics and video processing such a area?
- What in you opinion is the problem with these??

Yes, we can discuss this over Summer. AGI is in its broadest form may be a very hard problem and it may take a decade or two to make significant contributions. It may be worth looking at a narrower version of the problem that you may be able to attack in finite time bound using some existing mathematical and computational tools. I think DeepMind gang including Nando De Frietas and Marcus Hutter are the leading people looking at the AGI problem. 

We have to be cautious about picking problems when there are big groups with bright minds and lot of resources (software engineers and compute power) are looking at those problems -- the risk of getting scooped out is very high.

CptS 540 Artificial Intelligence
CptS 570 Machine Learning


I suggest you to register for 2 classes:
CptS 570 Machine Learning
CptS 561 Advanced Computer Architecture

The rationale is to have more time to do research as you will be an RA.

You can fill the remaining 4 credits using research credits (EE 700) -- You need 10 credits to be a RA.

You need to do two more core courses from computer engineering:
EE 434 in Spring 2018
EE 466 in Fall 2018

Here is a candidate plan to meet the course requirements without much effort.

- You need to take three mandatory courses in computer engineering as we discussed before.
- Since you have a lot of background in machine learning, you should be able to finish at least 5 classes with very little effort (Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Structured Prediction, Data Science).
- You need to do 2 more classes. If there are no specific classes that are relevant to your research, you can take couple of classes in software engineering -- won't take much time.

This will give you more time to focus on research and at the same time navigate the courses hurdle easily.
