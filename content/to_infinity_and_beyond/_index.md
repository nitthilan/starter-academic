# About

We have all grown up watching our super heros come to life with the Marvel cinematic universe. Don't you think it is now time to wear a suit and join them? With the rise of metaverse and the reality of the virtual worlds, we would be able to reealize our dreams of being vigilantes of the virtual universe. Our volumetric performance capture pipeline aims at easing the entire capture pipeline enabling everyone to live their dreams. Unlike traditional capture systems which ranges from high end lightstage based capture to multi-dslr camera setup we target to create our relightable virtual replicas using a single iPhone based captures. We utilize 3D deep learning technology to aide our volumetric performance capture and rendering pipeline. Our virtual counterparts are captured as PBR BRDF based texture components enbling them to be rendred in different environments from your 3D scanned home to the depths of mordor in LOTR. They would be compatible with traditional software stacks like Unity3D, Unreal Engine or Blender. Further, the models would be animated using markerless motion capture (mocap) technology. Our pipline on a high level could be brken down into three stages (a) Full body capture (b) Animation Performance Capture (c) Relightable Environment Renders. Our solutions unlocks the creativity in the hands of everyone to produce Hollywood style animation using just a mobile phone.

Narrative: How would you like to star in a Marvel movie? Create a virtual character which you could animate
Three stage process: Capturing a avatar (or a better word), Capturing animation (Learning animation weights), Rendering it in different environments
The different stages:

Technology used:




Videos and photos are used to capture our happy and memorable moments we shared with our friends and family. It takes us back to the place and time when the event happened, helping us reminiscence the moment. Instead, how would it be if we could capture these fleeting moments in 3D? Store and share them with your friends and family like you share photos and videos? Invite them to that moment so that we all could relive it? We are building a system to recreate an immersive experience to bring your memories to life in VR. Wanna ride along mail me @ nitthilan@gmail.com
