We have all grown up watching our super heros come to life with the Marvel cinematic universe. Do you think it is now time to wear a suit and join them? With the rise of metaverse and the reality of the virtual worlds, lets start building a volumetric performance capture system. Our projects targets an capture system, animation pipeline, workflow which helps capture a photorealistic cature system to create avatars. The avatars have the ability to be religtable unders different lighting conditions thereby enabling it to be used under different environments from the skies of star wars to the depths of mordor. They would also be animatable based on marker less motion capture system. We would also help in creating 3D environments in which we can place our 3D avatars. This makes the ability to create hollywood style animated movies in the hands of everyone with imagination and a mobile phone.  First, in our With the rise of Meta verse augumented and virtual reality more and more real world is recreated in the virtual world. More and more avatars are required. Ability to generate 3D avatars. Creating relightable avatars. Humans are catured with mesh and albedo and normal maps which can be used in any software stack like Unit3d, Unreal Engine Blender etc. 
Problems which we are trying to solve. Performance capture. 


Create 3D environments where you could transfer models

Creating 3D animated movies
Creating tikTok captures

Narrative: How would you like to star in a Marvel movie? Create a virtual character which you could animate
Three stage process: Capturing a avatar (or a better word), Capturing animation (Learning animation weights), Rendering it in different environments
The different stages:

Technology used:




Videos and photos are used to capture our happy and memorable moments we shared with our friends and family. It takes us back to the place and time when the event happened, helping us reminiscence the moment. Instead, how would it be if we could capture these fleeting moments in 3D? Store and share them with your friends and family like you share photos and videos? Invite them to that moment so that we all could relive it? We are building a system to recreate an immersive experience to bring your memories to life in VR. Wanna ride along mail me @ nitthilan@gmail.com
