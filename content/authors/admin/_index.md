I am  Nitthilan, pursuing PhD in AI/ML. Interested in artificial general intelligence (AGI) and Deep generative models (GAN, VQVAE) for Video/Image/3D Graphics (GCN/CNN).
- 12 years of software product development experience with wide exposure in building end to end
systems from embedded to web technologies.
- Passionate about developing optimized algorithms and exploring different domains. Developed
video applications for conferencing, broadcast, and storage. Worked on ME/RC for H264/MPEG
and developed plugin/webRTC/Html5 based video endpoints

Current Focus Area: Working on Neural scene representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. Extending the ideas of Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF, Liu et. al. 2020) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF, Mildenhall et. al. 2020) to

- Multi-resolution coarse to fine approach of learning
- Single image to scene representation
- Animate 3D objects by adding a time dimension.

PhD Research: My research is at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and Computing Systems (Sys). The overarching theme of my research is to bridge these two areas. Specifically, Iâ€™m working towards the vision of Edge AI to efficiently deploy AI solutions for emerging applications (e.g., robotics, selfdriving cars, augmented/virtual reality, and smart health) on edge platforms that are constrained by resources (power, compute, and memory).

(a) Developed a novel hardware-aware design and optimization framework to trade-off power, performance, and accuracy for performing inference using deep neural networks.

(b) Studied effective instantiations of this framework for different applications - Convolutional neural networks for image classification, Graph convolutional networks for 3D computer vision, and Generative adversarial networks for image manipulation tasks.

(c) Published papers at top-tier venues including three journal papers (ACM/IEEE Transactions
on CAD and Embedded Computing Systems) and four conference papers (AAAI, DAC, DATE,
ICCAD). One journal paper is under review at Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.
