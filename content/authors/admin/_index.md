I am  Nitthilan, pursuing PhD in AI/ML for Video/Image/3D Graphics. Interested in image and video based motion capture using pose based estimation (SMPLX, FrankMocap, SMPLify-X), clothing and hair 3D model representation using Implicit Neural Representation (NeRF, NSVF, Neural Body) and Deep generative models (GAN, VQVAE) .
- 12 years of software product development experience with wide exposure in building end to end
systems from embedded to web technologies.
- Passionate about developing optimized algorithms and exploring different domains. Developed video applications for conferencing, broadcast, and storage. Worked on ME/RC for H264/MPEG and developed plugin/webRTC/Html5 based video endpoints

Current Focus Area: 

- Extracting facial pose and full body motion capture (dance steps, sport stances, exercise and fitness poses) data from monocular video (YouTube, TikTok) using SMPLX prior (FrankMocap, SMPLify-X, VIBE)
- Controllable cloth, hair attribute and facial mocap of dynamic humans using SMPLX anchored latent codes (NeuralBody, FrankMocap, HumanParser)
- Accelerating learning of the 3D Neural Scene representation using smaller neural nets and latent representation at a voxel level [NeRF, NSVF, KiloNeRF].

PhD Research: My research is at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and Computing Systems (Sys). The overarching theme of my research is to bridge these two areas. Specifically, Iâ€™m working towards the vision of Edge AI to efficiently deploy AI solutions for emerging applications (e.g., robotics, selfdriving cars, augmented/virtual reality, and smart health) on edge platforms that are constrained by resources (power, compute, and memory).

(a) Developed a novel hardware-aware design and optimization framework to trade-off power, performance, and accuracy for performing inference using deep neural networks.

(b) Studied effective instantiations of this framework for different applications - Convolutional neural networks for image classification, Graph convolutional networks for 3D computer vision, and Generative adversarial networks for image manipulation tasks.

(c) Published papers at top-tier venues including three journal papers (ACM/IEEE Transactions on CAD and Embedded Computing Systems) and four conference papers (AAAI, DAC, DATE, ICCAD). One journal paper is under review at Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.
